# Implement Mobileye's 5 rules of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) as
# a metric compatible with driving gym.
# The five rules are
#   1)  Safe longitudinal distance to vehicles in the same lane
#   2)  Safe lateral distance to vehicles when merging lane
#   3)  Forfeiting right of way at junctions when another road user undermines
#       correct priority
#   4)  Additional caution in areas of occlusion
#   5)  Avoid a collision by any means without jeopardising safety of other
#       road users
